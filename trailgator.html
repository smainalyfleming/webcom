									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>Deep River is a small town with an approximate population of 4,994 (2017) in Renfrew county, Ontario. 
									It is located at a latitude of 46.0977° N and longitude of 77.4933° W between the Trans-Canada Highway and Ottawa river, 
									roughly 200 km northwest of Ottawa, the capital city of Canada. 
								
									The town has numerous recreational trails: hiking trails, biking trails, water trails, snowmobile trails. Our team 
									would like to create a GIS solution for all these trails. 
										</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Objectives</h3>
									The objectives of the Trail Mapping Project are to develop an interactive web/mobile application along with static maps 
									showing existing trails within Deep River. The solution will display useful information that will enable existing and trail users to easily 
									explore and plan their circuit along the selected trail.
									Static maps will allow recreational visitors to easily pinpoint existing trails and their surrounding area with 
									relevant information and, the web application will include the following:
									<ul>
									
									<li>Intuitive and user-friendly: not requiring prior experience with spatial applications </li>
										<li>Interactive and cross-platform: visitors can easily navigate and filter specific trail info and surrounding area details.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Proposed Service</h3>
									<p>The following step are suggested for the creation of the trail mapping.</p>
									<h3><strong> Data Acquisition and Pre-processing </strong></h3>
									<ul>
									<li> Analayse metadata of each feature and complete missing information </li>
									<li>Determine primary layers (e.g. Ski Trails, Biking Trails, Walking Trails, Water Trails) and secondary layers </li>
									<li>Determine base map data layer </li>
									</ul>
									<h3><strong> Programming/Customization </strong></h3>
									<ul> 
									<li> Configure and code the web application using low cost or free libraries</li>
									</ul>
									<h3><strong> Enterprise/Web Technology </strong></h3>
									<ul>
									<li>Create user-friendly interface offering metadata information through configured ‘pop-ups’ for trail and trail’s connections.</li>
									<li>Test the final solution to validate the web application is functional within the client environment </li>
									</ul>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Deliverables</h3>
									<p>The main component of the final deliverable will be an interactive web/mobile application showing trails, parks and POIs such as interesting 
									sites to visit while on trails, various clubs like the tennis and golf clubs located around the town, nearby amenities and as requested by the client the airport. 
									Additional features may also be added to ensure ease of navigation for tourist while using the application. 
									The following trail information will be displayed on the application in an on-click functionality in a pop-up table:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Trail Name </li>
									<li>Trail Difficulty  </li>
									<li>Average Time to Complete the trail </li>
									<li>Rules Set for the trail such as no pets allowed</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Accompanying the web application will be two printable poster maps giving a simple overview of the town with the trails included. The two variations of these maps
									will be one for the summer and one for the winter. Both maps will include the same information that can be found on the web application. These variations of the map 
									will be tailored in only displaying the best trails for that specific season. </p>
